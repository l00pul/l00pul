- ⚡ Fun fact: I created in 1998  the first European company offering online to anyone professional, modern and 
  secured Electronic signature services, acting as the only trusted alternative to the monopolistic and unfortunately 
  NSA-controlled and backdoored US corporation Verisign .
  The demand for the free market was so huge, both in Europe and Africa that I rapidly became the
  new flamboyant French press IT protege, having PLENTY of FREE press coverages weekly :)
  The French government and military, led in 1998 by socialist Prime Minister Jospin considered
  that my implementation of Esignature services for ALL was potentially a very dangerous
  applied CYBERWARFARE WEAPON and decided to take immediate control of it by BUYING in 1999 my startup, after only
  6 months of  operations.
  
  Since then I invested French state money in my birth country Romania, creating in 2000 my brand-shiny 
  new cybersecurity commercial firm, owned and managed by me 100% as its founder and CEO, offering as
  most trusted faithful counselors  to European customers trusted online influence, corporate branding and
  crisis and reputation management services.

  Our new star ENCRYPTED PRIVATE CLOUD service is by an order of magnitude  overall far better in terms of functionalities,
  blazing-fast  encrypted, fully redundant, replicated, and real-time backup-ed in two distinct European Union countries:
  Germany and Finland.
  Our permanent innovations brought by our brilliant engineers to the production ENCRYPTED CLOUD environment leave DE FACTO
  the two self-proclaimed CLOUD leaders Microsoft and Google in a very old RUSTY technological living
  MUSEUM as SLOW DINOSAURS, followed closely behind by more agile but still slower than us Apple Oracle and Amazon.
  As a bonus, we offer NEXTCLOUD as the modern Internet Swiss-knife appliance,
  and rely on bulletproof resilient postfix for sending and receiving millions of
  emails daily and Carbonio as the mighty successor of Zimbra as a professional
  email reader intensively used both in online or full offline operation mode.
